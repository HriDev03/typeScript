WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT AND WHY IT IS NEEDED?
we will define type of all the variables, will not have unexpected errors

HOW TO RUN TS CODE : 
Browser ko ts samajh nahi aata , soo first 
TS converts to JS and then it is exected , it is compiler using command tcs app.ts

// type script core data types : number,strings,boolean

compile time errors: Agar humm code likh rahe hai , tabh uss time mai error nahi dikhte

run time errors : jabh humm code likh rahe hai , and agar koi error aaye toh ts uss time pe errors show krr deta hai 
we cant give a direct object as a type, because agar type mai object de diya toh it can be anything 
it can be {} or it can have any value {fdfsdfsdfsfds}

so we dont give datatype as object we can send it in a {}
